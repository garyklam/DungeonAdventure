Welcome to the dungeon.

Your goal is to make it to the exit after finding all four pillars of OOP.

Each room you find can have a pit or a healing potion, both automatically affect your healthpoints.

If your health drops below 0, it's game over.

Vision potions can also be randomly found in the dungeon, using one will reveal the adjacent rooms on your map.

If your adventure proves too dangerous, the dungeon difficulty can be adjusted when creating a new game.

Best of luck on your search for the pillars and escaping the dungeon!
